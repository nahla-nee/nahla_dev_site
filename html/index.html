                Thanks for dropping by! How's your day going? Sorry there's no chat functionality on this website so I don't actually know what you said. I hope your day's been good though! Wanna check out some cool stuff I did? Of course you do, go on have a look around!
            </p>

                If you're wanting to know little bit more about me: I'm a computer science major currently at Boise State University, with an emphasis on cybersecurity, and I'm a software developer at MDU Resources where I work on the web dev team. I'm also currently obsessed with Rust! So if you want me to love you, talk to me about that.
